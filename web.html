                  redesign thispage.

                    There is a youtube video link on the website, but the user has to leave the webpage to view it.
                    Since we want to use less internet usage in the case when the user is on phone, we want to just show
                    the youtube on the page when the user is on PC (the screen size is at least the size of standard
                    PC).

                  <li>
                    The Information section is located towards the bottom of the page. Important information should be
                    placed towards the top so that the user can easily view it.
                  </li>
                  <li>The title scrolls from right to left, which seems to be unnecessary.</li>
                  <li>Website has a heart-shape cursor, but this is making things even harder to read.</li>
                  <li>The opacity of background image should be changed to make it easier to read the content.</li>
                  <li>
                    When the screen size changes, the main text takes up the entire width of the screen, making it hard
                    to read.

                  to detect possible accessibility problems. WebAIM WAVE detected quite a lot of contrast problems on
                  the website. I totally agree with this, and as I mentioned in the previous section, I believe that
                  changing the text color and background opacity will improve the overall readability. Additionally, it
                  alerts about the marquee element (scrolling content that the user can not stop). I believe that this
                  is also decreasing the readability of the page. Lastly, layout table is being used in the website.
                  This is some feature that should not be used in HTML5 according to WebAIM, which I agree with since it
                  decreases the readability of the page if the screen size changes.

                          Using the UI keyboard with a controller is annoying and hard. It takes far more time to type

                          Both personas have some similarities with some differences. First, both personas represent the
                          user who does not use PS4 from day-to-day basis, and also focuses on the fact that the user
                          has some experiences using a computer and/or other consoles such as XBox. Now, the first thing
                          that is most important to note is that the PS4 controller must be used with the PS4 in this
                          case. It is true that there are softwares that allows PS4/XBox controllers to be used on
                          computers, but in both personas, I assumed that PS4 controllers are only used when using PS4.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the case of persona 1, I focused on how the user would feel and experience when touching
                          the PS4 / PS4 controller for the first time. Clearly, one has to set up their account,
                          purchase a game, connect to the internet, etc. Most or all of these steps require a user to
                          use the controller, and most importantly, it involves a lot of console side UI keyboard inputs
                          (ex. typing keyword when searching for an app, entering wifi password). This can take a lot of
                          time especially when compared to keyboard inputs on a standard PC, so that is what I focused
                          on. In other words, this persona focuses on potential additional features that could be added
                          to the controller to ease the keyboard inputs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the case of persona 2, I focused on the strengths and weaknesses of the controller itself.
                          Figuring out sensitivity of the keys and buttons, how to plug microphones into the controller,
                          how it fits the user's hand is focused. This persona is made from the previous interview
                          section where users mentioned how the controller can not fit well for people with smaller
                          hands, or if one has a big hand, that it is hard to press a certain combination of buttons at
                          the same time.
